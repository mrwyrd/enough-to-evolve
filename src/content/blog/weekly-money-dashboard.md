Most budgets fail because they ask you to be perfect. I’m not. So I track a small set of numbers that tell me whether I’m safe, stable, or sliding.

This is the exact dashboard I use. It’s built for people who are:

- carrying multiple debts
- living on uneven income
- trying to climb out without losing their mind

## Why it matters
If you don’t know what’s due *before* your next paycheck, you’re flying blind. The dashboard turns a messy month into a weekly game you can actually win.

## The 7 numbers that matter
### 1) Cash buffer (today)
**Target:** eventually 1 month.

**Reality:** start with “enough to prevent fees.”

If the buffer is $0, you can’t run a plan—you can only react.

### 2) Total minimums due before next paycheck
This is the number that creates panic weeks. I want it visible.

### 3) Must‑pay bills due before next paycheck
Separate these from debt minimums. Must‑pays keep you functional.

### 4) “Leak” risk list (fees / overdrafts / subscriptions)
Each week I pick **one** leak to stop.

### 5) Highest‑interest debt (and the minimum)
I keep it simple: I want to know what’s most expensive to carry.

### 6) Next statement dates (not just due dates)
Statement dates control what gets reported. Timing can create quick wins.

### 7) One momentum move for the week
Examples:

- make one extra $25 principal payment to the target debt
- call for APR reduction
- negotiate a payment plan
- drive one extra shift and assign it to “remove one bill”

## Step‑by‑step (20 minutes)
1) Update balances (rounding is fine).
2) Check what’s due before the next paycheck.
3) Pick one leak to fix.
4) Pick one momentum move.
5) Set reminders for statement/due dates.

**Rule:** If I can’t run the dashboard in 20 minutes, it’s too complex.

## Example week (rounded/anonymized)
- Buffer: ~$150
- Minimums due before payday: ~$650
- Must‑pays before payday: ~$520
- Leak risk: overdraft fee + 2 subscriptions
- Highest‑interest card: ~30% APR, min ~$40
- Next statement date: in 6 days
- Momentum move: call for APR reduction + pay $25 before statement closes

That week’s “win” isn’t paying off a card—it’s preventing a fee and getting a better term.

## Checklist (copy/paste)
- [ ] Cash buffer updated
- [ ] Minimums due before payday
- [ ] Must‑pays due before payday
- [ ] One leak selected
- [ ] One momentum move scheduled
- [ ] Statement dates visible

## Common mistakes
- Tracking every category and skipping the only numbers that matter
- Ignoring statement dates and losing quick reporting wins
- Forgetting to assign extra income to a specific outcome

## Mini FAQ
**Do I update this daily?**
No. Weekly is the point. Daily turns into guilt.

**What if I miss a week?**
Restart on the next payday. The system doesn’t punish you.

**Is this a budget?**
It’s a control panel. Budgets are fine, but this keeps you out of the ditch.
