Most budgets fail because they ask you to be perfect. I’m not. So I track a small set of numbers that tell me whether I’m safe, stable, or sliding.

This is the exact dashboard I use (with a free template). It’s designed for people who are:

- carrying multiple debts
- living on uneven income
- trying to climb out without losing their mind

## The 7 numbers that matter
### 1) Cash buffer (today)
**Target:** eventually 1 month.

**Reality:** start with “enough to prevent fees.”

If the buffer is $0, you can’t run a plan—you can only react.

### 2) Total minimums due before next paycheck
This is the number that creates panic weeks. I want it visible.

### 3) Must-pay bills due before next paycheck
Separate these from debt minimums. Must-pays keep you functional.

### 4) “Leak” risk list (fees / overdrafts / subscriptions)
Each week I pick **one** leak to stop.

### 5) Highest-interest debt (and the minimum)
I keep it simple: I want to know what’s most expensive to carry.

### 6) Next statement dates (not just due dates)
Statement dates control what gets reported. Timing can create quick wins.

### 7) One momentum move for the week
Examples:

- make one extra $25 principal payment to the target debt
- call for APR reduction
- negotiate a payment plan
- drive one extra shift and assign it to “remove one bill”

## The weekly ritual (20 minutes)
1) Update balances (rounding is fine)
2) Check what’s due before the next paycheck
3) Pick one leak to fix
4) Pick one momentum move
5) Set reminders for statement/due dates

**Rule:** If I can’t run the dashboard in 20 minutes, it’s too complex.

## Example week (rounded/anonymized)
- Buffer: ~$150
- Minimums due before payday: ~$650
- Must-pays before payday: ~$520
- Leak risk: overdraft fee + 2 subscriptions
- Highest-interest card: ~30% APR, min ~$40
- Next statement date: in 6 days
- Momentum move: call for APR reduction + pay $25 before statement closes

That week’s “win” isn’t paying off a card—it’s preventing a fee and getting a better term.

## Template
I’m packaging this as the **Debt Escape Dashboard** (Google Sheet) with:

- balances + minimums table
- due date calendar view
- “momentum move” tracker
- call script log
