If you’re doing Uber (or any gig driving), your gross earnings are **not** your pay.

This calculator method gives you a realistic net number you can plan with.

## Step 1: Start with gross earnings
Take your weekly gross from the app.

Example: $600 (rounded)

## Step 2: Subtract variable driving costs (gas)
A simple estimate:

- miles driven ÷ mpg = gallons
- gallons × gas price = fuel cost

Example:
- 450 miles ÷ 30 mpg ≈ 15 gallons
- 15 × $3.20 ≈ $48

## Step 3: Set aside taxes (rule-of-thumb)
This varies by situation.

A rough starting point if you’re not already setting aside:
- 20% of (gross − gas)

Example:
- $600 − $48 = $552
- 20% ≈ $110

## Step 4: Account for vehicle wear (maintenance/depreciation)
You can do this two ways:

**Simple:** $0.10–$0.20 per mile

Example: 450 × $0.15 = $67.50

## Step 5: Your estimated net
Example:
- Gross: $600
- Gas: −$48
- Taxes set-aside: −$110
- Wear: −$68

Estimated net: **~$374**

That’s the number you can safely assign toward a goal.

## What to do with the number (momentum rule)
Don’t spend net like it’s fun money.

Assign it to remove future problems:
- “one bill removed” (one debt payment eliminated)
- buffer
- a targeted paydown move
