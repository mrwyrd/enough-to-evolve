If you’re doing Uber (or any gig driving), your gross earnings are **not** your pay.

This calculator method gives you a realistic net number you can plan with.

## Why it matters
If you assign gross to bills, you’ll feel broke even on a “good” week. Net keeps your plan honest.

## Step‑by‑step calculator
### 1) Start with gross earnings
Take your weekly gross from the app.

Example: **$600** (rounded)

### 2) Subtract variable driving costs (gas)
A simple estimate:

- miles driven ÷ mpg = gallons
- gallons × gas price = fuel cost

Example:
- 450 miles ÷ 30 mpg ≈ 15 gallons
- 15 × $3.20 ≈ **$48**

### 3) Set aside taxes (rule‑of‑thumb)
This varies by situation. A rough starting point if you’re not already setting aside:

- 20% of (gross − gas)

Example:
- $600 − $48 = $552
- 20% ≈ **$110**

### 4) Account for vehicle wear (maintenance/depreciation)
Two simple options:

**Simple:** $0.10–$0.20 per mile

Example: 450 × $0.15 = **$67.50**

### 5) Your estimated net
Example:
- Gross: $600
- Gas: −$48
- Taxes set‑aside: −$110
- Wear: −$68

Estimated net: **~$374**

That’s the number you can safely assign toward a goal.

## Example: assign it to momentum
- $100 buffer
- $150 toward minimums
- $124 to remove one small payment

Even a “small” week can create a future win.

## Checklist
- [ ] Gross earnings recorded
- [ ] Gas cost estimated
- [ ] Taxes set aside
- [ ] Wear estimated per mile
- [ ] Net assigned to a specific outcome

## Common mistakes
- Treating reimbursements and bonuses as “extra” without deducting costs
- Ignoring wear/maintenance because it’s not a cash expense *today*
- Paying bills from gross and getting trapped in shortfalls

## Mini FAQ
**Should I use IRS mileage?**
It’s fine for taxes, but for planning I prefer a simpler per‑mile estimate so I can move quickly.

**What if gas price changes?**
Update it weekly. The whole point is to stay honest.

**Do I need to track every trip?**
No. Weekly totals are enough to make good decisions.
