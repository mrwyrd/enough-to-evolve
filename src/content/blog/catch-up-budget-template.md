When you’re behind, a normal budget feels like cosplay.

You don’t need a perfect category system. You need a **catch‑up plan** that answers, in order:

1) *What keeps my life functional this week?* (must‑pays)
2) *What prevents damage fees/closures?* (minimums)
3) *What reduces future problems?* (momentum)

Below is the template I use. It’s built for uneven income, multiple debts, and “surprise” weeks.

## Why it matters
The catch‑up budget is triage. It keeps you housed, stops the worst fees, and buys you enough stability to make progress later.

## The Catch‑Up Budget (4 buckets)
### Bucket 1: Must‑pays (keep the lights on)
These are the bills that, if missed, break your life quickly.

Examples:
- housing
- utilities
- car payment / insurance
- minimum viable groceries

**Rule:** Must‑pays get funded before you get fancy.

### Bucket 2: Minimums (prevent defaults)
This is where you stop the credit‑score/fees spiral.

Examples:
- credit card minimums
- loans (minimum)

**Rule:** If you can’t cover all minimums, you’re in triage mode (see below).

### Bucket 3: Buffer (stop “surprise” from becoming debt)
Buffer is not a vibe. It’s a circuit breaker.

Start small:
- $50
- then $100
- then “one bill”

### Bucket 4: Momentum (one move that reduces future pain)
Momentum is where progress comes from.

Examples:
- one extra $25 principal payment on the target debt
- one phone call to reduce APR / waive fees
- one extra driving shift assigned to “remove one payment”

## Step‑by‑step weekly flow (20 minutes)
1) List money coming in before next payday.
2) List must‑pays due before next payday.
3) List minimums due before next payday.
4) Fund must‑pays → minimums → buffer.
5) Pick **one momentum move**.

If you do those five steps every week, you stop being surprised.

## Example (rounded/anonymized)
- Income before payday: ~$1,150
- Must‑pays: ~$620
- Minimums: ~$310
- Buffer: $50
- Momentum move: call for APR reduction + pay $20 early on target card

## Checklist
- [ ] Income before payday listed
- [ ] Must‑pays funded first
- [ ] Minimums covered (or triage applied)
- [ ] Buffer funded, even if small
- [ ] One momentum move scheduled

## Triage order (if you can’t cover everything)
This is the order I use when money is short (rounding and anonymizing numbers is fine):

1) housing
2) utilities
3) car + insurance (if it’s required for income)
4) minimums that prevent immediate account closure / repossession
5) everything else

This is not financial advice. It’s survival math.

## Common mistakes
- Treating subscriptions like must‑pays
- Skipping the buffer because it “feels small”
- Spreading money across every debt instead of protecting essentials

## Mini FAQ
**Isn’t this just a budget?**
It’s a survival‑first budget. The order matters more than the categories.

**What if I have past‑due bills?**
Put them in must‑pays or minimums depending on what breaks first.

**How long should I stay in catch‑up mode?**
Until your buffer stops bleeding and minimums are consistent.
