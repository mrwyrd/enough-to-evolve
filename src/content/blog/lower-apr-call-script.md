If you’re stuck paying interest, the fastest win is often **changing the terms**, not grinding extra $10 payments.

Here’s a call script you can use to ask for:
- an APR reduction
- a hardship program
- late-fee/interest waiver

*(This is not legal/financial advice; it’s a practical script.)*

## Before you call (2 minutes)
Have ready:
- your current balance (rounded is fine)
- your current APR (or “I’m not sure, please tell me”)
- your payment history (“I’ve been paying on time for X months”)
- what you want: **lower APR** or **hardship program**

## The script
> Hi — my name is ____. I’m calling because my interest rate is making it hard to make progress.
>
> I want to keep this account in good standing. Can you check if there are any options to **reduce my APR** or move me to a **hardship program**?
>
> If there’s a hardship plan, what are the terms — APR, payment amount, and duration?

### If they offer a smaller thing first
> Thanks. Is there anything better available if I speak with a supervisor or retention?

### If they say “no”
> Okay. What would need to be true for this to be approved? Is it based on tenure, payment history, utilization, or something else?
>
> And can you note on my account that I called to request an APR reduction today?

### If they offer a hardship program
Ask these explicitly:
- Is the APR reduced, or is it just a payment plan?
- Does it require closing or freezing the card?
- Does it report as a hardship program?
- When does the new APR/payment start?

## What to log (so it becomes momentum)
Create a simple log:
- date
- rep name/id
- offer (APR/payment/duration)
- next action

If you call 3 times over 30 days, the odds go up.
