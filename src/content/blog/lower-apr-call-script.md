If you’re stuck paying interest, the fastest win is often **changing the terms**, not grinding extra $10 payments.

Here’s a call script you can use to ask for:
- an APR reduction
- a hardship program
- late‑fee/interest waiver

*(Not legal/financial advice; just a practical script.)*

## Why it matters
Lower APR = fewer dollars burning every month. One successful call can save more than months of micro‑payments.

## Step‑by‑step: the 10‑minute prep
Have ready:
- your current balance (rounded is fine)
- your current APR (or “I’m not sure, please tell me”)
- your payment history (“I’ve been paying on time for X months”)
- what you want: **lower APR** or **hardship program**

## The script
> Hi — my name is ____. I’m calling because my interest rate is making it hard to make progress.
>
> I want to keep this account in good standing. Can you check if there are any options to **reduce my APR** or move me to a **hardship program**?
>
> If there’s a hardship plan, what are the terms — APR, payment amount, and duration?

### If they offer a smaller thing first
> Thanks. Is there anything better available if I speak with a supervisor or retention?

### If they say “no”
> Okay. What would need to be true for this to be approved? Is it based on tenure, payment history, utilization, or something else?
>
> And can you note on my account that I called to request an APR reduction today?

### If they offer a hardship program
Ask these explicitly:
- Is the APR reduced, or is it just a payment plan?
- Does it require closing or freezing the card?
- Does it report as a hardship program?
- When does the new APR/payment start?

## Example outcome log (rounded/anonymized)
- Date: Feb 3
- Rep: “JB”
- Request: lower APR or hardship
- Offer: APR drop from ~29% → ~19% for 12 months
- Next action: call back 60 days before promo ends

## Checklist (copy/paste)
- [ ] Balance + APR in front of me
- [ ] Ask: “Any APR reduction or hardship options?”
- [ ] Ask: terms, duration, and whether card closes
- [ ] Log rep name + offer
- [ ] Set a reminder if temporary

## Common mistakes
- Calling without your ask (you’ll get a generic “no”)
- Accepting a payment plan that *doesn’t* reduce APR
- Forgetting to set a reminder when a promo expires

## Mini FAQ
**Will this hurt my score?**
APR reductions usually don’t. Hardship plans might; ask how it’s reported.

**How often can I call?**
I try 2–3 attempts over 30–45 days.

**What if I’m already late?**
Ask for a fee waiver first, then negotiate terms.
