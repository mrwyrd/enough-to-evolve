If you’re making minimum payments and still feeling like you’re losing, you’re not crazy—the system is designed to keep you treading water.

**Enough To Evolve** is my public field journal for climbing out: the numbers, the mistakes, what worked, and what didn’t. I’m not a CFP. I’m building a repeatable system under real constraints and publishing it so you can copy it.

## What “Minimums to Momentum” means
Minimum payments are a *survival setting*. Momentum is when your money starts removing future problems:

- one less payment
- one less fee
- one less “gotcha” week
- a buffer that stops emergencies from becoming debt

The goal isn’t perfection. The goal is **reliable progress**.

## The 4-part method
### 1) Stabilize (stop the bleeding)
Before you “pay off debt faster,” you have to stop the leaks:

- late fees
- overdrafts
- random bill chaos
- “minimums ate my entire paycheck” weeks

**Rule:** if your cashflow is unstable, paydown strategies fail.

### 2) Control (make the numbers obey)
This is the boring part that changes everything:

- statement dates vs due dates
- where each dollar goes *before* it’s spent
- a weekly review so problems show up early

**Rule:** I don’t “hope” money works out. I *assign* it.

### 3) Paydown (reduce the number of problems)
Once cashflow stops surprising you, you can attack debt with consistency.

This site focuses on strategies that work when you’re not living in a spreadsheet fantasy:

- hybrid avalanche/snowball depending on cashflow
- scripts to lower APRs or get hardship terms
- “one extra payment” tactics that create wins without breaking the month

### 4) Grow (income stacking without burnout)
If the margin is too thin, the fastest path is usually:

- cut the worst leaks
- stack reliable income
- convert it into *removing a payment*, not upgrading lifestyle

## My content promise
Every post will include at least **two** of the following:

- real examples with rounded/anonymized numbers
- original templates (spreadsheets, scripts, checklists)
- the decision rules I actually used
- what happened after I tried it

If I can’t make it concrete, I won’t publish it.

## Start here (15 minutes)
1) Download the free toolkit (Dashboard + Scripts + Tracker)
2) Fill in just the top-line numbers (balances, minimums, due dates)
3) Pick **one leak** to stop this week (fee, overdraft, a bill you can negotiate)

## What to read next
- Catch-up budget template (when you’re behind)
- Debt snowball vs avalanche (when cashflow is tight)
- How to ask for a lower APR (exact script + outcomes log)
- Uber net pay calculator (profit, not revenue)
