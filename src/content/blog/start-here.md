If you’re making minimum payments and still feeling like you’re losing, you’re not crazy. The system is built to keep you treading water.

**Enough To Evolve** is my field journal for climbing out. I’m not a CFP. I’m building a repeatable system under real constraints and publishing it so you can copy it.

## Why this matters
Minimum payments are a *survival setting*. Momentum is when your money starts removing future problems:

- one less payment
- one less fee
- one less “gotcha” week
- a buffer that stops emergencies from becoming debt

The goal isn’t perfection. The goal is **reliable progress**.

## The 4-part method (Minimums → Momentum)
### 1) Stabilize (stop the bleeding)
Before you “pay off debt faster,” you have to stop the leaks:

- late fees
- overdrafts
- random bill chaos
- “minimums ate my entire paycheck” weeks

**Rule:** If cashflow is unstable, paydown strategies fail.

### 2) Control (make the numbers obey)
This is the boring part that changes everything:

- statement dates vs due dates
- where each dollar goes *before* it’s spent
- a weekly review so problems show up early

**Rule:** I don’t “hope” money works out. I *assign* it.

### 3) Paydown (reduce the number of problems)
Once cashflow stops surprising you, you can attack debt with consistency.

This site focuses on tactics that work when you’re not living in a spreadsheet fantasy:

- hybrid avalanche/snowball depending on cashflow
- scripts to lower APRs or get hardship terms
- “one extra payment” moves that create wins without breaking the month

### 4) Grow (income stacking without burnout)
If the margin is too thin, the fastest path is usually:

- cut the worst leaks
- stack reliable income
- convert it into **removing a payment**, not upgrading lifestyle

## Step-by-step: your first 7 days
1) List all minimums + due dates (round numbers are fine).
2) Identify the single bill or fee that scares you most.
3) Build a 20-minute weekly check‑in (see the dashboard below).
4) Pick **one** momentum move you can complete in 7 days.
5) Assign any extra money to remove a future problem (not a nice‑to‑have).

## Example (rounded/anonymized)
- Total minimums: ~$820
- Must‑pays before next paycheck: ~$560
- Buffer: ~$90
- Highest APR card: ~29% APR, min ~$35
- Momentum move: pay $25 *before* statement close + call for APR reduction

That week wasn’t a “big win,” but it prevented a fee and lowered interest. That’s the start.

## Checklist (10 minutes)
- [ ] All minimums listed with due dates
- [ ] One leak to stop this week
- [ ] One momentum move scheduled
- [ ] Cash buffer target set (even if it’s $50)
- [ ] Next statement dates visible

## Common mistakes I made (so you don’t have to)
- Chasing a perfect budget before stabilizing cashflow
- Paying extra on debt while late fees kept stacking
- Ignoring statement dates and missing quick wins
- Treating side income like spending money instead of problem removal

## Mini FAQ
**Do I need a full budget?**
No. Start with minimums, must‑pays, and one weekly decision.

**What if I can’t cover all minimums?**
You’re in triage mode. Fund must‑pays, then minimums that prevent immediate damage. Use the catch‑up template.

**How much buffer should I have?**
Start with “enough to prevent fees,” then build toward one month.
