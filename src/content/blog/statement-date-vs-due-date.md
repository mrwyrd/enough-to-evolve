If you’re only tracking due dates, you’re missing half the game. **Statement dates** decide what gets reported and when interest starts.

## Why it matters
The statement date is the snapshot. The due date is the deadline. If you time a payment before the statement closes, you can:

- reduce reported balances
- lower interest for the next cycle
- make your cashflow feel less chaotic

## The simple rule
- **Statement date = reporting cutoff**
- **Due date = final deadline**

Paying before the statement closes can create quick wins even if you can’t pay in full.

## Step‑by‑step: find your dates
1) Open your last statement or app.
2) Record the statement closing date.
3) Record the due date.
4) Set two reminders: 3 days before statement close, 3 days before due date.

## Example (rounded/anonymized)
- Balance: ~$1,200
- Statement closes: Feb 10
- Due date: Feb 25
- Payment on Feb 8: $150

Result: statement reports ~$1,050 instead of $1,200, and interest is slightly lower next cycle.

## Checklist
- [ ] Statement date recorded
- [ ] Due date recorded
- [ ] Reminder set before each date
- [ ] Small pre‑statement payment planned

## Common mistakes
- Thinking the due date is the only date that matters
- Paying after the statement closes and wondering why the balance looks high
- Missing the reminder window by “just a day”

## Mini FAQ
**Do statement dates change?**
Sometimes. Check after any account change or new card.

**What if I can only pay once per month?**
Then try to pay before the statement close. The timing still helps.

**Does this fix high interest?**
No, but it reduces how much you’re charged *this* cycle.
