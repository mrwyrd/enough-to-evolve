Minimum payments are designed to keep accounts alive, not to get you free. They keep the lights on, but they don’t build momentum.

## Why it matters
If you only pay minimums, most of your money goes to interest. That means:

- balances fall painfully slow
- one emergency puts you back to zero
- the payoff date drifts further away every time you miss a month

## The simple calculator method (no fancy spreadsheet)
You only need three numbers:

- balance
- APR
- minimum payment

### Step 1: Estimate monthly interest
Use this quick approximation:

`monthly interest ≈ balance × (APR ÷ 12)`

Example:
- Balance: $2,000
- APR: 27%

Monthly interest ≈ $2,000 × 0.27 ÷ 12 ≈ **$45**

### Step 2: See how much of the minimum actually hits principal
If your minimum is $60:

- $60 − $45 = **$15 principal**

That’s the trap: you’re paying mostly interest.

### Step 3: Find the “escape number”
Add a small extra amount until your principal movement feels real.

- Minimum: $60
- Extra: $40
- New total: $100
- Principal now: $100 − $45 = **$55 principal**

That’s a different game.

## Example (rounded/anonymized)
- Card A: $1,400 at 29% APR, min $35
- Monthly interest ≈ $34
- Principal movement: ~$1 per month

Adding **$30** turns it into ~$31 principal. Same card, totally different trajectory.

## Checklist
- [ ] Balance recorded
- [ ] APR recorded
- [ ] Monthly interest estimated
- [ ] Principal portion of minimum calculated
- [ ] “Escape number” target set

## Common mistakes
- Paying extra on every card instead of one target
- Ignoring APR and guessing the interest hit
- Celebrating “on‑time payments” without checking principal movement

## Mini FAQ
**Should I stop paying minimums?**
No. Minimums keep you out of late fees and damage. The goal is to *add* a focused extra amount.

**What if I can’t add extra?**
Then the win is control and stability: stop fees, lower APR, and build buffer first.

**Is this snowball or avalanche?**
It’s a reality check. Use it to decide where extra dollars matter most.
